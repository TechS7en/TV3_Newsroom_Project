# TV3 Newsroom Project (College Group Assignment)

This repository contains a student-built front-end prototype of a news website created for a web development course. The site mimics a fictional TV3 newsroom and was developed as part of a group project to demonstrate HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills.

## Team Members

- Member A (e.g. Nickks) – JavaScript logic & data handling
- Member B – HTML structure & layout
- Member C – CSS styling & responsive design
- Member D – Content writing & testing

*(Replace names with actual group members.)*

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repo.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser to view the homepage.
3. No build tools or servers are required; everything runs locally.

## What’s Included

The mock site includes several pages to simulate a simple news portal:

- **Homepage (`index.html`)** – Featured story, latest news grid, trending sidebar, breaking ticker
- **Category page** – Filter news by topic (Politics, Business, Sports, Entertainment, Technology)
- **Single story page** – Full article view with comments and related posts
- **Live TV page** – Dummy YouTube embed with a program schedule
- **Contact/Tip page** – Form with validation, stores submissions in `localStorage`
- **Admin dashboard** – View/delete stored tips, comments, and click statistics

All interactions are handled via JavaScript; there is no backend.

## How We Worked

- Team meetings were held weekly to assign tasks and review progress.
- A shared Google Doc tracked story ideas and content requirements.
- GitHub was used for version control; each member created branches for features.
- Final testing was done on Chrome and Firefox, with feedback incorporated.

## Learning Objectives

- Practice DOM manipulation and event handling with vanilla JS.
- Implement form validation and client-side data persistence.
- Build a responsive layout using flexbox/grid.
- Collaborate on a small web project using Git.
